# Social Media Writer Skill

Create scroll-stopping content for social platforms with proper formatting, hashtags, and engagement hooks.

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Twitter/X

**Format:**
- Max 280 characters per post
- Use threads for longer content
- 2-3 hashtags maximum
- @mentions for people/companies

**Structure:**
```
Hook | First line, grab attention
Body | Main content, value
CTA | Question or link
Tags | #hashtag1 #hashtag2
```

**Best Practices:**
- Start strong - first line determines if they'll read more
- One idea per tweet
- Use line breaks for readability
- Add image when relevant
- End with question or CTA
- Schedule for optimal times (varies by audience)

**Thread Format:**
```
Tweet 1: Main point + 🧵
Tweet 2: Supporting point 1
Tweet 3: Supporting point 2
Tweet 4: Example or data
Tweet 5: Summary + CTA

Use "🧵" to indicate thread, number each tweet
```

### LinkedIn

**Format:**
- 3-5 short paragraphs
- Professional but conversational
- One main takeaway
- Include image/document
- 3-5 hashtags
- 1-2 relevant @mentions

**Structure:**
```
Hook | Personal story or surprising fact
Point 1 | First insight
Point 2 | Second insight with example
Point 3 | Third insight
Takeaway | Actionable conclusion
CTA | Question or next step
```

**Best Practices:**
- Write like you're talking to a colleague
- Share failures, not just successes
- Use bullet points for readability
- Tag relevant people/companies
- Post during business hours
- Include professional image

### Other Platforms

**Facebook:**
- Longer form, conversational
- Ask questions to encourage comments
- Use images/videos
- Post timing matters (evenings, weekends)

**Instagram:**
- Visual-first
- Short, engaging captions
- 10-30 hashtags
- Stories for behind-the-scenes
- Reels for video content

**Threads/Bluesky:**
- Similar to Twitter
- More character space
- Image/video friendly

## Content Types

### Thread from Blog Post
```
Hook from main insight
Tweet 1: Main point
Tweet 2: Supporting detail 1
Tweet 3: Supporting detail 2
Tweet 4: Example or quote
Tweet 5: Personal takeaway
Tweet 6: Link to full post
```

### LinkedIn from Article
```
Hook: "I spent [time] doing [task]. Here's what I learned:"
Para 1: The challenge
Para 2: The process
Para 3: Key insight
Para 4: Actionable advice
CTA: "What's your experience?"
```

### Quick Tips
```
Twitter: One practical tip, one emoji
LinkedIn: Expand with context
Instagram: Turn into visual + short caption
```

### Job Posting
```
Twitter: Short teaser + link to full post
LinkedIn: Full description with requirements
Both: Tag company, use relevant hashtags
```

## Hook Formulas

### Twitter Hooks
1. **Contrarian**: "Unpopular opinion: [opinion]"
2. **Numbered**: "5 things I learned from [experience]"
3. **Before/After**: "Before [X], I [Y]. After [X], [Z]."
4. **Secret**: "Here's what nobody tells you about [topic]"
5. **Mistake**: "I wasted [time] on [thing]. Here's what I wish I knew."

### LinkedIn Hooks
1. **Story**: "In 20 years of [field], I've never seen..."
2. **Realization**: "I finally figured out [topic]..."
3. **Counter-intuitive**: "Doing less of [X] led to more [Y]..."
4. **Failure**: "My $10k mistake and what I learned..."
5. **Framework**: "The 3-step framework I use for [task]..."

## Engagement Tactics

### Ask Questions
```
Twitter: "What's your experience?"
LinkedIn: "How do you handle this?"
Both: "Agree or disagree?"
```

### Use Polls
```
Twitter: Built-in poll feature
LinkedIn: "React with ❤️ if you agree"
```

### Tag Strategically
```
- People mentioned in content
- Companies/products referenced
- Influencers in your niche
- People you want to connect with
```

## Hashtag Strategy

### Twitter
- 1-3 hashtags max
- Mix of broad and specific
- Research trending tags
- Create branded hashtag

### LinkedIn
- 3-5 hashtags
- More professional/relevant
- Less trendy, more descriptive
- Consider industry-specific tags

## Common Mistakes

### Twitter
- Too many hashtags (looks spammy)
- No line breaks (hard to read)
- Link buried at end
- Thread not numbered

### LinkedIn
- Too long (loses readers)
- Too salesy
- No personal element
- Generic advice ("work harder")
- No formatting (wall of text)

## Tone by Platform

| Platform | Tone | Length | Emojis | Hashtags |
|----------|------|--------|--------|----------|
| Twitter/X | Casual, concise | 280 chars | Yes | 2-3 |
| LinkedIn | Professional, personal | 3-5 paras | Few | 3-5 |
| Instagram | Casual, visual | Short | Many | 10-30 |
| Facebook | Conversational | Medium | Some | 5-10 |
| Threads | Twitter-like | Longer | Yes | 2-3 |

## Examples

### Twitter - Good
```
I spent 4 hours debugging a single line of code.

Turns out, I was checking the wrong variable entirely.

What's your "I can't believe I did that" debugging story?
🧵
```

### LinkedIn - Good
```
I've been remote for 5 years. Here's what nobody tells you:

1. You'll work MORE, not less
2. "Work from anywhere" ≠ "Work from vacation"
3. Your home office will become your cage

The fix?
• Set strict office hours
• Get out of the house daily
• Create a separate workspace

Remote work is great—but only with boundaries.

What's been your biggest challenge working from home?
```

### Bad Examples
```
❌ "Check out our innovative solution!"
❌ "Excited to announce!" (without context)
❌ "Please like and share!"
❌ "In today's world..." (cliché)
```
