# Analytical Blog Writing Skill

Create data-driven, well-researched analytical content that demonstrates expertise and provides genuine value.

## Core Principles

1. **Data over opinion** - Support claims with evidence
2. **Depth over breadth** - Deep dive, not surface level
3. **Original research** - Bring new insights, not just summaries
4. **Clear methodology** - Explain how you reached conclusions
5. **Cite sources** - Give credit to original sources
6. **Acknowledge limitations** - What you don't know

## Article Structure

### Analytical Article Format

```markdown
# [Specific, Descriptive Headline]

## Executive Summary
3-4 sentence overview of findings

## The Question
What we investigated and why it matters

## Methodology
How we gathered and analyzed data

## Findings
Present data with charts/quotes

## Analysis
Interpret the findings, draw connections

## Implications
What this means for the reader/industry

## Limitations
What this analysis doesn't cover

## Conclusion
Key takeaways and next steps
```

## Research Process

### 1. Define the Question
- Make it specific
- Make it answerable
- Explain why it matters

### 2. Gather Data
- Primary sources (original research, interviews)
- Secondary sources (reports, studies)
- Ensure data is recent and relevant

### 3. Analyze
- Look for patterns
- Identify outliers
- Find correlations
- Check for biases

### 4. Present
- Visualize when helpful
- Use specific numbers
- Provide context
- Acknowledge uncertainty

## Data Visualization

### When to Use Charts
- Comparing quantities
- Showing trends over time
- Displaying distributions
- Illustrating relationships

### Chart Guidelines
- Label axes clearly
- Include data sources
- Add context in caption
- Keep it simple

### Text Alternatives
Always provide text interpretation:
```
The chart shows that traffic increased 45% after the redesign,
from 10,000 to 14,500 daily visitors.
```

## Writing Style

### Use Specific Numbers
```
❌ "Significant increase"
✅ "43% increase (p < 0.01)"
```

### Provide Context
```
❌ "Users loved the new feature"
✅ "12 out of 15 users said they'd recommend it,
    and 3 said they'd pay for it"
```

### Show Your Work
```
❌ "Our analysis shows..."
✅ "We analyzed 50,000 user sessions over 30 days,
    comparing behavior before and after the redesign.
    Here's what we found:"
```

## Types of Analysis

### Comparative Analysis
- Compare A vs B
- Present data side-by-side
- Draw clear conclusions

### Trend Analysis
- Show change over time
- Identify patterns
- Make predictions (with caveats)

### Correlation vs Causation
- Be careful claiming causation
- Show correlation data
- Discuss alternative explanations

### Case Study
- Real-world example
- Specific problem and solution
- Measurable outcomes
- Lessons learned

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Claims supported by data
- [ ] Data sources cited
- [ ] Methodology explained
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged
- [ ] Visualizations are clear
- [ ] Numbers are specific
- [ ] No cherry-picking data
- [ ] Counter-evidence considered
- [ ] Uncertainty communicated
- [ ] Next steps suggested

## Common Pitfalls

### Cherry-Picking
- Selecting only data that supports your thesis
- **Solution**: Present all relevant data

### Overstating Results
- Making stronger claims than data supports
- **Solution**: Use precise language

### Ignoring Context
- Presenting numbers without background
- **Solution**: Always provide context

### Confirmation Bias
- Only looking for evidence that confirms your view
- **Solution**: Seek disconfirming evidence

## Example Opening

```
❌ "In today's data-driven world, analytics is important..."

✅ "Last month, our team noticed something strange:
    mobile traffic was up 67%, but conversion was down 12%.
    We spent 3 weeks investigating why. Here's what we found."
```

## Tone Guidelines

- **Professional but accessible**
- **Confident but not overconfident**
- **Precise but not pedantic**
- **Objective but not dry**

## Commands

- `/analytical [topic]` - Write analytical article on topic
- `/analyze-data [dataset]` - Analyze provided data
- `/case-study [project]` - Write case study

## Notes

- Always date your analysis
- Update when new data available
- Share raw data when possible
- Welcome feedback and corrections
