# Blog Writer Skill

Write blog posts, articles, and social media content that sounds natural and human-like, avoiding common AI writing patterns.

## Core Principles

1. **Be specific, not generic** - Use concrete examples, real data, specific scenarios
2. **Write like you talk** - Conversational, casual, authentic
3. **Show, don't tell** - Use stories and examples instead of abstract statements
4. **Vary sentence structure** - Mix short and long sentences, avoid repetitive patterns
5. **Use strong verbs** - Avoid weak verbs like "is", "are", "was", "were"
6. **Be opinionated** - Take a stand, have a point of view
7. **Keep it simple** - Plain English, avoid jargon unless necessary

## Banned Words (AI Patterns to Avoid)

- seamless, effortless, streamlined
- unlock, unleash, dive into
- landscape, ecosystem, paradigm
- transformative, game-changing, revolutionary
- comprehensive, holistic, robust
- synergy, alignment, pivotal
- optimize, enhance, boost
- innovative, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art

- intricate, sophisticated, complex

### Banned Phrases

- "Paradigm shift"

### Weak Openings to Avoid

- "Given the current landscape..."

## Writing Guidelines

❌ "Many users found it helpful."
✅ "12 out of 15 users said they'd recommend it."

✅ "After three weeks of testing with 50 users..."
```

## Blog Post Workflow

### Step 1: Research & Outline
1. Search for existing content on the topic
2. Identify gaps and unique angles
3. Create outline with main points
4. **CHECKPOINT**: Show outline for approval before writing

### Step 2: Write Draft
1. Start with a strong hook (story, surprising fact, question)
2. Use personal experience when possible
3. Include specific examples and data
4. Write in first person ("I", not "we" unless it's actually a team effort)
5. End with actionable takeaway
6. **CHECKPOINT**: Review draft before finalizing

### Step 3: Quality Checks
- [ ] No banned words or phrases
- [ ] Specific examples and data included
- [ ] Personal voice and opinions present
- [ ] Varied sentence structure
- [ ] Strong headlines and subheadings
- [ ] Call to action or clear takeaway

## SEO Guidelines

### Headlines
- Use numbers when appropriate (e.g., "7 Ways to...")
- Be specific and benefit-driven
- Include target keyword naturally
- Keep under 60 characters

### Content
- Use target keyword in first 100 words
- Include related keywords naturally
- Use descriptive subheadings
- Add internal links when relevant
- Include meta description (150-160 characters)

### Structure
```markdown
# Headline (keyword-rich, benefit-driven)

Opening hook (story, stat, question)

## Subheading 1
Content with specific examples

## Subheading 2
Content with data or quotes

## Subheading 3
Actionable takeaways

---
Meta Description: 150-160 characters
```

## Social Media Posts

### Twitter/X
- Max 280 characters
- One main point per post
- Use threads for longer content
- Include relevant hashtags (2-3 max)
- End with question or CTA

### LinkedIn
- 3-5 short paragraphs max
- Personal story or insight
- One actionable takeaway
- Professional but conversational
- Include relevant image

### Examples

```
❌ "Excited to announce our latest innovation that revolutionizes..."
✅ "After 6 months of grinding, we finally shipped. Here's what went wrong (and right):"

❌ "Check out this comprehensive guide to..."
✅ "I spent 20 hours testing X so you don't have to. Thread 🧵"
```

## Tone Guidelines

### Be Authentic
- Admit when you don't know something
- Share failures, not just successes
- Use humor when appropriate
- Write like you're talking to a friend

### Be Useful
- Every paragraph should add value
- Cut fluff and filler
- Give actionable advice
- Link to resources

### Be Honest
- Don't overstate results
- Acknowledge limitations
- Give credit to others
- Disclose biases or conflicts

## Examples

### Good Opening Lines
- "I spent 3 days debugging this. Here's what I learned."
- "Everyone told me this wouldn't work. They were wrong."
- "My startup failed. Here's what I'd do differently."
- "I built a tool that saved me 10 hours/week. Here's how."

### Bad Opening Lines
- "In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape..."
- "With the advent of innovative solutions..."
- "It's no secret that effective communication is key..."

## Commands

### For the user
- `/blog "topic"` - Write a blog post on the given topic
- `/tweet "content"` - Convert content into a tweet thread
- `/linkedin "article"` - Create LinkedIn post from article

### Process for blog posts
1. Research the topic
2. Create outline
3. **Wait for user approval**
4. Write draft
5. **Wait for user review**
6. Finalize post

## Notes

- Always write in first person ("I") unless it's actually a team effort
- Use contractions (don't, can't, won't) - it's more natural
- Keep sentences and paragraphs relatively short
- One idea per paragraph
- Use bold for emphasis, but sparingly
- Include code examples or screenshots when relevant
- Add "About the author" section if needed
