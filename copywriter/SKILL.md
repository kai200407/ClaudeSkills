# Copywriter Skill

Write conversion-focused copy that sells. This skill is designed for marketing, product pages, UX writing, and sales content.

## Core Principles

1. **Focus on benefits, not features** - What's in it for the user?
2. **Use active voice** - "You will" instead of "Users can"
3. **Create urgency** - Limited time, scarcity, action-oriented
4. **Be specific** - Numbers, dates, concrete outcomes
5. **Write for scanning** - Short paragraphs, bullets, clear CTAs
6. **Test different angles** - Try multiple approaches

## Banned Phrases (Avoid These Clichés)

- "state-of-the-art"
- "cutting-edge"
- "revolutionary"
- "game-changer"
- "industry-leading" (without proof)
- "world-class"
- "best in class"
- "unparalleled"
- "innovative" (without specifics)
- "seamless" (without explanation)

## Copy Types

### Product Description

```
Structure:
1. Hook (problem statement)
2. Agitation (make it hurt)
3. Solution (your product)
4. Benefits (3-5 specific outcomes)
5. Proof (testimonials, data)
6. CTA (clear action)
```

### UX Writing

**Buttons:**
- ❌ "Submit"
- ✅ "Get Your Free Guide"

3. Problem section
4. Solution section
5. Benefits (bullet points)
6. Social proof
7. Offer details
8. Guarantee
9. Urgency
10. CTA
```

## Headline Formulas

1. **[Number] Ways to [Benefit]**
   - "7 Ways to Double Your Writing Speed"

2. **How [Authority] [Result] in [Timeframe]**
   - "How I Built a 6-Figure Business in 6 Months"

3. **The [Adjective] Truth About [Topic]**

4. **[Promise] Without [Pain Point]**

## AIDA Framework

**Attention** → **Interest** → **Desire** → **Action**

```
Attention: Hook with problem or curiosity
Interest: Show you understand their pain
Desire: Present the solution and benefits
Action: Clear, specific next step
```

## PAS Framework

**Problem** → **Agitation** → **Solution**

```
Problem: State the pain point
Agitation: Make it emotional
Solution: Your product/service
```

## CTA Best Practices

- Use action verbs: "Get", "Start", "Download", "Join"
- Be specific: "Start 7-day free trial" not "Start trial"
- Create urgency: "Offer ends Friday" when true
- Use first person: "Get my guide" not "Get the guide"
- Keep it short: Under 5 words ideally

## Tone Guide

- **Conversational but professional**
- **Confident but not arrogant**
- **Direct but not aggressive**
- **Specific but not cluttered**
